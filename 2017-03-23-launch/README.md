## What are "Community Shout Outs"

Shout outs are a way of letting the meetup group know about events, projects, other meetup groups, tools, and anything you think will be of interest. 

* Form orderly queue
* 60 seconds max (shorter if possible!)
* Write the details on a sticky note
    * A title
    * Your name
    * Contact details: twitter / email / website
    
If you prefer not to speak in front of a group - chat to an organiser and they will do the shout out for you
